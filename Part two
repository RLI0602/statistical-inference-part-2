Tooth Growth Data 
Overview: For this project, I will load Tooth Growth Data in R and perform some basic exploratory data analyses.

boxplot(len~supp, data=ToothGrowth, main="Boxplot of Tooth Length when grouped according to OJ/VC", ylab="Tooth Length")
The bulk of tooth lengths are in the similar range when guinea pigs are given OJ or VC. But VC is more spread out in a wider range compared to OJ
ToothGrowth$dose=as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose)
boxplot(len~dose, data=ToothGrowth, main="Boxplot of Tooth Length when grouped according to doses", ylab="Tooth Length")
When guinea pigs are treated to different dose, their tooth length varies distinctly. Those pigs that are given 2mg generally have longer teeth, followed by 1.0mg and 0.5mg.   
Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Test 
Confidence T test of supp with the null hypothesis stating that there is no difference in Tooth Growth when using OJ or VC.
t.test(len~supp, data=ToothGrowth)
the p-value (0.06) is greater than 0.05 so we have insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis
Confidence T test of dose with the null hypothesis stating that there is no difference in Tooth Growth when dose changes 
t.test(len~dose, data=ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose==0.5|ToothGrowth$dose==1.0,])
p-value is smaller than 0.05 so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 

Assumptions 
Data is assumed to be normally distributed and t tests we used given the relatively low sample size. Two groups supp and dose are assumed to be independent. 
Base on the results of Confidence intervals above, I conclude that guinea pigs tooth length will bot be affected if given OJ or VC. However, their teeth will grow longer if the doses of these supps are heavier.
